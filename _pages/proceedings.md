Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. Following the precious years, the proceedings of
TIME are planned to be published in the LIPIcs-Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics. This is a series of high-quality peer-reviewed conference proceedings, and published according to the principle of OpenAccess.

In addition, we note again that the authors of the top-ranked papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their contribution to a journal special issue; more details will be provided in due time.
