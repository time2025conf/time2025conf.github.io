### Topics

- Spatio-temporal representation and reasoning models (including moving objects tracking)
- Temporal Logics for finite and infinite state systems
- Model checking with temporal issues 
- Temporal constraint models and satisfiability 
- Temporal networks (including Bayesian networks, Neural networks, etc)
- Formal and applied Ontologies of time and space (including Semantic Web and Interoperability)
- Temporal knowledge graphs
- Time in Natural Language Processing (including LLMs and argumentation frameworks)
- Reasoning about action and change (including Temporal Planning and scheduling)
- Diagnosis and Supervision of Real-Time systems (including Controller Synthesis, Timed Automata and Petri nets)	
- Preferences and Uncertainty management in temporal knowledge (including belief states, probabilistic and fuzzy models)
- Event and Pattern recognition (including time series and temporal chronicles)
- Temporal data learning (Neural/Deep Learning and Symbolic/Reinforcement Learning) 
- Temporal data sensing, discovery and mining 
- Temporal databases and dedicated query languages
- Indeterminate and imprecise temporal data
- Specification and verification of systems (including runtime verification of temporal properties)
- Temporal aspects of agent- and policy-based systems (including Multi-agent systems and Markov decision processes)

The list above is by no means exhaustive, as the aim is to foster the debate around all aspects of time in automation.

### Submission guidelines

TIME 2025 accepts submissions in PDF format, formatted following the [LIPIcs instructions](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) and preferably using LaTeX (please note that you will need to change the copyright information with \Copyright{CC BY-NC-SA 4.0}). TIME policy is single blind, so the names of the authors need not be hidden in the submitted draft. Members of the program committee are allowed to submit papers. Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality, and relevance to the symposium. At least one author of each accepted paper must register at the symposium and present the paper.

We will use the OpenReview platform throughout the submission and selection process. The webpage for submitting with all required information can be found [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=time-symposium.org/TIME/2025/Symposium)

There are **three types** of submissions, and the authors are invited to specify under which one their paper lies:

1) Original papers (12 pages, excluding references and appendix): such papers describe original, non-published contribution. It includes theoretical (new algorithms, proofs, models) and applied (applications, system descriptions, evaluation) contributions.

2) Survey paper (12 pages, excluding references and appendix): such papers are intended to propose a short review of a complete domain of research.

3) Extended abstract (4 pages, excluding references and appendix): such abstracts are intended to foster debates during the symposium and include: work-in-progress, project kick-off or review, PhD summary, and summary of a paper accepted in a major conference or journal. They will be specifically mentioned in the proceedings as abstracts and not full papers.
