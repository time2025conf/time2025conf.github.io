### Topics

In this symposium, in addition to theoretical and practical work in Artificial Intelligence, Databases, and Logic and Reasoning, we invite submissions focusing on the development, deployment, and evaluation of Machine Learning Systems that fall under the scope of the symposium. Such systems papers will be evaluated primarily on the quality of the empirical evaluation and reusability. Topics for TIME 2025 include (but are not limited to):

- Spatial and temporal reasoning
- Time in natural language processing
- Reasoning about action and change
- Complex event recognition and forecasting
- Planning and planning languages
- Ontologies of time and space-time
- Belief and uncertainty in temporal knowledge
- Temporal learning and discovery
- Temporal data models and query languages
- Temporal query processing and indexing
- Temporal data mining
- Stream data management
- Spatio-temporal data management, including moving objects
- Data currency and expiration
- Indeterminate and imprecise temporal data
- Temporal constraints
- Specification and verification of systems
- Verification of software and web applications
- Synthesis and execution
- Model checking algorithms and implementations
- Temporal logics for infinite-state systems
- Runtime verification of temporal properties
- Temporal aspects of agent- and policy-based systems
- Temporal networks
- Temporal argumentation frameworks
- Automata-theoretic techniques for temporal reasoning
- Temporal knowledge graphs
- Time-series data management
- Events and time series explanations in healthcare
- The list above is by no means exhaustive, as the aim is to foster the debate around all aspects of the suggested topics.

Finally, the authors of the top-ranked papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their contribution to a journal special issue; more details will be provided in due time.


### Submission

The submission link: TBA


### Guidelines

TIME 2025 accepts submissions in PDF format, no longer than 12 pages excluding references and appendix. The appendix is limited to 5 pages, and the reviewers may or may not take it into account for their recommendation. Submissions must be formatted following the LIPIcs instructions and preferably redacted in LaTeX.

TIME policy is single blind, so the names of the authors need not be hidden in the submitted draft. Members of the program committee are allowed to submit papers. Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality, and relevance to the symposium.

Submissions to TIME 2025 must be original; parallel submissions of the same material to other conferences or journals are not allowed. At least one author of each accepted paper must register at the symposium and present the paper.

All questions about submissions should be emailed to the organizers.

### Important Dates

- June 15, 2025: Paper submission deadline
- June 13, 2025: Paper acceptance/rejection notification date
- July 27: Camera-ready submission deadline
- August 18, 2025: Registration deadline
- August 27â€“29, 2025: Symposium dates

Note: all deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth).
