Please note that due to several requests we have decided to extend the paper submission deadline:

- May 20, 2025: Abstract submission deadline
- <s>May 22</s> <b>May 26, 2025: Paper submission deadline</b>
- June 25, 2025: Paper acceptance/rejection notification date
- August 1st, 2025: Camera-ready submission deadline
- August 18, 2025: Registration deadline
- August 27â€“29, 2025: Symposium dates

Note: all deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

Please note that we will be able to consider exceptional requests to extend the paper submission deadline, with supporting arguments (please let us know in advance) but the abstract deadline is absolutely strict and cannot be postponed.
