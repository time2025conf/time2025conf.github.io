## 32nd International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning, 27-29 August 2025, London, UK

TIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different scientific fields involving temporal and spatio-temporal data, information and/or knowledge management. Such a concern arises in a number of different though often related research domains, namely Artificial Intelligence (both symbolic approaches based on explicit Logic or Constraint-based models, and numerical data-based approaches such as Deep Learning and Large Language Models), Databases and Data Mining, or System Specification and Verification.
